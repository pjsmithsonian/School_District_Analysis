# School_District_Analysis

## Overview 
After our initial analysis of the student data, it was discovered that there may be some academic dishonestly occurring for the Thomas High School 9th graders. To correct for this we are doing another anslysis removing this population of the analysis. This is our report on how these updates have impacted the previous analysis.

## Results
Below is how these changes impacted the analysis.
### District
 - District Summary
	- the removal of Thomas High School's 9th grade lowered the Average Math Score, % Passing Math, as well as % Overall Passing values by less than one percent. While these values were not significantly lowered, it does weaken the district's overall performance.

### School
 - School Summary
	- The impact to the school was actually increased percentages of % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing. This is because we did not include these 9th grade scores for the school and with only the 10th through 12th scores, the % increased.

	
### Data Change Impacts

How does replacing 9th grade data impact the following:
 - Relative between Thomas High School and Other Schools
	- Thomas High School, even with removing the 9th grade values, performs well relative to other schools. With and without the 9th grade scores they finish in the top 2 performing schools in the district.
  - Math and Reading scores by grade
	- This was not impacted other than that the 9th grade average no longer exists.
  - Scores by School Spending
	- This also remained unchanged.
  - Scores by School Size
	- This also remained unchanged.
  - Scores by School Type
	- This also remained unchanged.
	
## Summary
While there weren't too many changes from our removal of the 9th grade scoring data from Thomas High school, the largest 4 are as follows.
 1. Increase of the Thomas High School percentages of passing students overall as well as in the individual % Passing Reading and % Passing Math categories.
 2. The decrease in the Average Math Score for the district's performance.
 3. The lack of data to analyze for the 9th grade at Thomas High School. If there is anything to improve there, we will have to wait until new data is available.
 4. While we were able to do analysis on the values we knew were legitimate, it is difficult as a whole to analyze the district due to this lack of data. Results would be more effective if we could say that we had a complete data set.
